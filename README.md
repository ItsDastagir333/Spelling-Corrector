# Spelling Corrector

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a spelling corrector using a simplified model of language based on the "Bag of Words" approach. The model captures word frequencies to suggest corrections for misspelled words. The notebook demonstrates the application of edit distance and provides functions for correcting words in a given text.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItsDastagir333/spelling-corrector.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository:**
   ```bash
   cd spelling-corrector
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open the `Spelling_Correction.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment and execute the cells to see the spelling correction in action.

## Overview

- **Data Source:**
  The spelling corrector uses a large text file (`big.txt`) as the source for language modeling.

- **Bag of Words Model:**
  The model simplifies language by focusing on word frequencies, using a "Bag of Words" approach.

- **Spelling Correction:**
  The notebook provides functions to find the most likely correction for a given word based on edit distance and word frequencies.

- **Edit Distance:**
  Edit distance calculations are used to determine candidate corrections, including deletions, transpositions, replacements, and insertions.

- **Application:**
  The notebook demonstrates the correction of words within a text and provides insights into the language model's predictions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
